# Java_Serialization
-Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. 
-Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.
In this piece of code I implemented the serialisation as well as Deserialization to the linked list objects of java .
