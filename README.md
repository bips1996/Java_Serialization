# Java_Serialization

-Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. <br>

-Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory. <br>

<strong>In this piece of code I implemented the serialisation as well as Deserialization to the linked list objects of java .</strong>
